# Rust RL

Rust RL is a modular reinforcement learning (RL) library designed for flexibility and performance. It leverages the candle backend for efficient computations.

## Key Features

- Modular Design: Easily plug in or extend components.

- Candle Backend: Efficient and flexible computation using the candle library.

## Roadmap

- Core trait definitions for agents and environments

- Enhanced backend features using Candle

- Future asynchronous training methods

- Potential multi-agent environment support
